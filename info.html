        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>You can draw points on the square canvas in the middle of the screen.</p>
        <p>Then you can visualize finding the convex hull of the points using two different algorithms.</p>
        <p>On the left are stats displayed, how fast the algorithm is and in which state you are currently in.</p>
        <p>With the "clear points" button you can clear the points and stop an algorithm from running.</p>
        <p>Under the canvas is a slidebar, where you can set your own delay.</p>
        <p>On the left the min delay is 0.1s and on the right the max delay is 2s.</p>

        <h1>Algorithm for finding convex hull, naive approach</h1>
        <p>This algorithm finds the convex hull in O(n^3).</p>
        <p>The blue line is the line that currently gets checked if its a "Randkante"</p>
        <p>The red line is a already found "Randkante"</p>
        <p>The grey line is a already checked edge which isnt a "Randkante"</p>

        <h1>Jarvis-Wrap-Algorithm for finding convex hull</h1>
        <p>This algorithm finds the convex hull in O(nh)</p>
        <p>In the first step it searches for the farthest point on the right.</p>
        <p>The green point is the farthest point to the right already found.</p>
        <p>The blue point is the point that gets checked if its farther to the right than the green point.</p>
        <p>The grey points are the points that are already checked and arent farthest to the right currently</p>
        <p>In the second step, the algorithm searches for "Randkanten" counterclockwise</p>
        <p>The red lines are already found "Randkanten"</p>
        <p>The green line is the line that currently gets checked as a potential next "Randkante"</p>
        <p>This is done by comparing it with the blue lines</p>
        <p>Sometimes the algo overwrites already drawn lines, but I'm to lazy to change it, sorry!</p>
